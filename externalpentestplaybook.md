**Before we start**:  
Verify scope: https://bgp.he.net/net/199.120.48.0/24  
**Attack strategy**: 
Low chance of rce, high chances of weak pass/2fa  
OSINT and logical guessing  
Nessus scan - all ports

**OSINT**:  
Hunting breached creds: dehashed - paid   
Could use Heath adams https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse //uses breachdata  
find email,users,employees -- phonebook.cz  //good enough  
Validate user accounts/emaiL -- from login/forgot pass  
Other useful info: password policy, job postings, google search of company  

**Attacking login portals**: once we have valid user account/emails  
Attacking O365: trevorspray github against valid email  
Attacking OWA(Outlook Web App): on-prem exchange servers, msfconsole auxiliary/scanner/htp/owa_login  
Other portals: hydra/burp intruder  

**Bypassing MFA**:  dafthack/mfasweep, can login to multiple microsoft services  
mailsniper  - same check if any service doesnt need mfa and run password search in email if email service was bypassed  

**Escalating access**:  
gather info, move other apps say azure portal, connect to vpn, search mailbox, mozilla bookmarks etC  

a company -->employee accounts/emails-->portal(outlook/O365/Web)-->MFAbypass-->escalate acces
